1. What is Hyper visor
2. Docker Engine
3. Docker Daemon

AFTER INSTALLING DOCKER GIVING REQUIRED PERMISSIONS
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
Now to avail docker we need to do *sudo reboot* after this command.

DOCKER COMMANDS
1. docker pull mysql :-it take pull of mysql image from docker hub
2. docker images :- shows all the images present
-docker ps :- shows the docker conatiners running.
3. docker run -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=***** mysql:latest :- this will run mysql conatiner in detached mode refer dia

DOCKER FILE--BUILD--IMAGES PULL -->>RUN==>>CONTAINERS

	TO INTERACT WITH MYSQL 
docker exec -it *conatinerID* bash :- will open mysql bash
mysql -u root -p :- to enter the password

INSTALLING NGINX IMAGE BY DOCKER
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx:latest
We can check whether it is installed or not thro' public ip address of instance.

RUNNING A REACT-DJANGO PROJECT USING DOCKER

1. mkdir projects
2. cd projects
3. git clone *HTTPS LINK*

4. vim Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
COPY CWD .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python","manage.py","runserver","0.0.0.0:8000"]

5. docker build . -t react-django-app:latest
6. docker run -d -p 8000:8000 react-django-app:latest

step: got to security groups and open inbound traffic by add rule button then access thro' browser.

RUN VS CMD 
The steps to create images we write in RUN while steps to create the conatiner we write as command CMD
